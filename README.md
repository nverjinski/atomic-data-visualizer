# atomic-data-visualizer
A study in optimization, leveraging virtualization and atomic state management to orchestrate the visualization of 10,000+ high-dimensional computer vision samples. This project explores the synchronization between a simulated Python backend and a React frontend, ensuring sub-60ms responsiveness during rapid data filtering and asset lazy-loading.
